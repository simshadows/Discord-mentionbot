# Simbot

A small Discord bot, hardcoded to only work on my servers.

*I might update it to be general-purpose, but not now.*


## Running this bot

1) [Install Rust tooling.](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

    - *(Rust isn't in a lot of package repositories yet, so you may need to download an installer/script.)*

2) `export DISCORD_TOKEN=yourtokenhere`

3) `cargo run`
